unified_applications \- Unified controller applications 
.PP
These applications are convenience controllers allowing the user to determine the working mode and current setting of his Witmotion sensor device\&.
.SH "Message enumerator"
.PP
The \fCmessage_enumerator\fP controller application is always built by default along with the library\&. It allows the user to capture and enumerate every \fBoutput data packet\fP produced by the sensor device connected to the given UART port\&. It tries to find if every incoming packet ID is registered in \fBwitmotion_registered_ids\fP list\&. If the packet ID is found, the packet will be logged and mapped with the corresponding description string from \fBwitmotion_packet_descriptions\fP table\&. After the program will be stopped by the user with \fCCtrl+C\fP keystroke, all the captured packets will be enumerated with their descriptions, and the unknown IDs will be also reported and enumerated\&.
