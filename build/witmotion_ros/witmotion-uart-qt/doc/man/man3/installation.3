As the library relies on \fBQt\fP backend, \fCQt5::QSerialPort\fP package or the proper \fCQt >= 5\&.2\fP installation and \fCCMake\fP are required to build the library\&. In Debian-based distributions all the required software could be installed with the following command: 
.PP
.nf
sudo apt install gcc g++ build\-essential libqt5serialport5\-dev cmake

.fi

The typical build script for the library looks like the following: 
.PP
.nf
git clone https://github\&.com/ElettraSciComp/witmotion_IMU_QT\&.git witmotion\-uart\-qt
cd witmotion\-uart\-qt && mkdir build && cd build
cmake \&.\&.
make

.fi

.SH "Install"
.PP
Since the installation scripts are WIP, there is no installation step needed to use the library\&. You can use the binaries placed in \fCbuild\fP subdirectory after successful call of \fCmake\fP\&.
